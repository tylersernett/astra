        If you've been injured in a car accident, it's crucial to get a 
        timely diagnosis and start your treatmentâ€”even 
        if you haven't yet retained an attorney. Contact us first to 
        schedule an appointment with an experienced physician who can 
        guide you through your recovery process.

        If you've already received emergency room care following a car accident 
        but are struggling to find follow-up care, we can help. We'll quickly connect 
        you with a board-certified physician who specializes in treating auto collision 
        injuries and we'll ensure that your ER treatment records are promptly available 
        for your ongoing care.
